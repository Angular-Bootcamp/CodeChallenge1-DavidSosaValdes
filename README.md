## Installation

First off, let's install all the dependencies:

	npm install
	bower install

Next move all the assets to their directories with the `npm` command:

	bower-installer

Finally compile the main stylesheet using LESS with the command:

	lessc src/less/styles.less > public/css/styles.css
